batcomputer: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=497abb33ba7b0370d501f173facc947759aa4e22, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped

gdb-peda$ checksec
CANARY    : disabled
FORTIFY   : disabled
NX        : disabled
PIE       : ENABLED
RELRO     : Partial

So no canary and no NX. We can put shellcode in stack and this is probably a b-ovflo
Cool

Okay so its giving out some address for Joker. Address is changing. Let me try again with disabling ASLR and then running, but anyway

It's also asking for a password so I'll check for a strcmp in ghidra

First, if ASLR is randomizing the address. Yes it is! I disabled it and now I have a conisistent address to where Joker is 

ggwp bpw

0x7fffffffdf24 -> location of Joker ALSO THE ADDRESS OF THE STACK. WE HAVE THE RETURN POINTER

Now password of batmobile

b4tp@$$w0rd! -> got it from ghidra



read(0,auStack84,0x89); It is reading 137 bytes

And the buffer size is only 76
GGWP Bois we have a buffer overflow



We can use a /bin/sh script and try and get it?

Pattern offset is 84 
Time to start writing the code for the exploit, we have everything we need


Okay the server has ASLR enabled so first we have to track the joker lol
