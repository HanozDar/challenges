Alright so from analysing the file
I can tell that the challenge solution is a heap exploitation
Maybe a buffer Overflow, but not sure yet

So let's analyse a bit
Flag file is being stored here
ILE *f = fopen("api","r");
	if (!f) {
		printf("Flag file not found. Contact an admin.\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	fgets(api_buf, FLAG_BUFFER, f);
	
Flag is in the buffer in the buy_stonks function

There is a format string vuln in the function 
printf(user_buf);

Let's just dump the entire buffer lol

ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3nc42a6a41 }

This is what we get when we exploit the format string vulnerability

Because it is in little endian, we have to decode it from an online decoder

Once I got that, I wrote a small program that basically coverts it from little endinan to normal
Pasted that as flag and we have it!
