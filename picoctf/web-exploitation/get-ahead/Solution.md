# Pico Gym Web Exploitation Get aHEAD
This challenge was pretty simple
The title was get aHEAD

So for the red background, we were sending an empty GET request
For the Blue Background, we were sending an empty post request 
So, since we have a massive hint from the title itself, 
we can just send the following request and get the flag

```text
