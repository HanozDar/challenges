# challenges
Random Challenges that I have solved from various sites. Can be either python code or writeups.

Now, since there is an active duty challenge, and there might be some in the future as well, just wget the zip file and unlock it with the flag in the original format
So, if it's an HTB Flag, just unzip it with "HTB{PuT_th3_fl4g_H3re}" 

Thank you!
