# challenges
Random Challenges that I have solved from various sites. Can be either python code or writeups.

Now, since there are active duty challenges, just download the zip file and unlock it with the flag in the original format
So, if it's an HTB Flag, just unzip it with "HTB{PuT_th3_fl4g_H3re}" 


I've also added some RingZer0 coding challenge writeups. I'd solved this a long time ago, but lost the code for it, thought it'd be fun to re-do them!

Adding to that, in preperation of my finals, I'm doing the Narnia buffer overflow challenges as well as Ringzer0 linux pwnage challenges, so I'll upload the writeups to those as well!

I've also got some writeups to the Cyber Santa CTF lined up for this repository after the finals are done, so I'll be uploading those soon.

Thank you for visiting!
