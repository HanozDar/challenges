Probably means that we have to write shellcode in the buffer

2 functions are there

0x00000000000011b9  initialize
0x0000000000001229  main

Let's open in ghidra

I think I found the buffer overflow. Let's start writing the script

We found offset to be 104 gg ez

So we have to use shellcode that is between 0x1 to 0x30 wtf
What do I even do 
Oh lol I found alphanumeric shellcode
